.I Note:
Profanity is using GNU Readline library to handle input so
default configuration file
.I ~/.inputrc
affects operation. In addition to that
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/profanity/inputrc
is read after all default keybindigs are set so one can override
or add settings there. For reference, see Readline documentation:
.I "info readline ""Command Line Editing"" ""Readline Init File"" ""Readline Init File Syntax"""
and the list of available Profanity commands in
.IR inputwin.c .
Standard Readline keybindings are supported, including
.B C-r
for interactive history search and
.B C-x C-r
for reloading inputrc without restart.
