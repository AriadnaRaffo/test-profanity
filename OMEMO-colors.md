# OMEMO colors - colorful OMEMO chats

The main goal of this MarkDown is to organize the ideas for this feature that has the potential to become an interesting and useful feature for every profanity's user, IMHO. The chosen color must not cause eyestrain on long OMEMO chats sessions. I'll try to keep this document updated as I make progress in the development.

## TODO list
- [X] Understand how to implement the option `/omemo color on|off` (default: off).
- [X] Implement `/omemo color on|off`.
- [X] Understand how `/save` works, getting a light grasp of it is sufficient.
- [ ] Implement sent OMEMO messages are white, received OMEMO messages are darker white.
- [ ] When `/omemo color on`, implement sent OMEMO messages are white, received OMEMO messages are darker white.
- [ ] Understand how to insert `color` in the autocompletion.

-------------------------------
- [ ] Support OMEMO colors on MUC. NOTE: profanity doesn't support OMEMO on MUCs yet.
- [ ] Develop a contrast checker to choose which color for OMEMO received messages should be used based on the loaded theme.

Further ideas:
- [ ] (optional) create a background around OMEMO messages.
- [ ] opaqueness of non-OMEMO messages?
